# Arxis Project Governance

## Project Leadership

Arxis is currently maintained by **Nicolas ﾃ」ila** as the founding developer and project lead.

### Maintainer
- **Name**: Nicolas ﾃ」ila
- **Email**: nicolas@avila.inc
- **GitHub**: [@avilaops](https://github.com/avilaops)
- **WhatsApp**: +55 17 99781-1471
- **Role**: Project founder, lead developer, and maintainer

## Decision Making Process

### Current Phase: Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL)

As Arxis is in active development with a single primary maintainer, decisions are made by Nicolas ﾃ」ila with community input through:

1. **GitHub Discussions** - Feature discussions and design decisions
2. **GitHub Issues** - Bug reports, feature requests, and proposals
3. **Pull Requests** - Code contributions with review process
4. **Direct Communication** - Email or WhatsApp for urgent matters

### Future Governance Model

As the project grows, we plan to transition to a **Meritocratic Governance** model:

1. **Core Team**: Active contributors with commit access
2. **Maintainers**: Responsible for specific crates or subsystems
3. **Contributors**: Community members who submit PRs and participate in discussions
4. **Steering Committee**: (Future) For major architectural decisions

## Contribution Process

### 1. Proposal Stage
- Open a **GitHub Discussion** or **Issue** for significant changes
- Describe the problem, proposed solution, and alternatives
- Gather community feedback (minimum 7 days for major changes)

### 2. Review Stage
- Submit a **Pull Request** following the PR template
- Automated CI checks must pass
- Code review by maintainers
- Address feedback and requested changes

### 3. Acceptance Stage
- PR is approved by a maintainer
- Merged to main branch
- Contributor is acknowledged in CHANGELOG
- Changes included in next release

## Types of Changes

### Minor Changes (Direct PR)
- Bug fixes
- Documentation improvements
- Code cleanup/refactoring
- Test additions
- Performance optimizations (non-breaking)

**Process**: Submit PR directly, no prior discussion needed

### Major Changes (Discussion First)
- New crates or major modules
- Breaking API changes
- Significant architectural changes
- New dependencies
- Performance changes that may break compatibility

**Process**: Open Discussion or Issue first, then PR after consensus

## Crate Ownership

### Current Ownership (All: Nicolas ﾃ」ila)
- `arxis_quaternions` - Main library
- `avila-math` - Mathematical kernel
- `avila-telemetry` - Time series & analytics
- `avila-compress` - Compression library
- `avila-tokenizers` - NLP tokenization
- `aviladb` - Database system
- `avx-*` - AVL Platform crates

### Future Ownership Model
As the project grows, we'll establish **crate maintainers** for each major component.

## Release Process

### Version Numbering
We follow **Semantic Versioning 2.0.0**:
- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes
- **MINOR**: New features (backward compatible)
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes (backward compatible)

### Release Cycle
- **Patch releases**: As needed for critical bugs
- **Minor releases**: Monthly or when features are ready
- **Major releases**: When breaking changes accumulate

### Release Checklist
1. Update version in `Cargo.toml`
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md`
3. Run full test suite (`cargo test --workspace`)
4. Run `cargo clippy` and `cargo fmt`
5. Create git tag (e.g., `v0.3.0`)
6. Publish to crates.io
7. Create GitHub Release with notes
8. Update documentation site
